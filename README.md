# chromeBandcampDownloaderExtension
Scrapes mp3s from album pages on bandcamp.

# Notes
This is super barebones now, just makes a get request and uses regex to pull out the URLs. This is not resistant to updates nor is it guaranteed to work on various types of bandcamp pages.

No metadata is processed, so you're on your own for that.
